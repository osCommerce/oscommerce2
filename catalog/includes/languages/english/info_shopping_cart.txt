This allows the member to add products to their shopping cart, and come back at a later date to finalize their checkout. All products remain in their shopping cart until the member has  checked them out, or removed the products themselves.
sub_heading_text_3 = If a member adds products to their \'Visitors Cart\' and decides to log in to the online shop to use their \'Members Cart\', the contents of their \'Visitors Cart\' will merge with their \'Members Cart\' contents automatically.
